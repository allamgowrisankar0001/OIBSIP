      <h1>About the Legend</h1>
      <p>
        Ratan Naval Tata (born December 28, 1937 – 2024) was an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and one of the
        most respected business leaders in the world.
        He served as the Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, India’s largest conglomerate, leading it with vision,
        humility, and integrity.
        Under his leadership, Tata Group expanded globally, acquiring iconic brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley,
        and Corus Steel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond business, Ratan Tata was known for his deep compassion and commitment to social good.
        He believed that businesses should not only create wealth but also improve lives.
        Through the Tata Trusts, he contributed billions to healthcare, education, rural development, and scientific
        research — making a lasting impact on millions of people across India.
      </p>

      <p>
        He embodied simplicity and humanity, often seen driving himself or spending time listening to young
        entrepreneurs.
        To many, he was not just a business icon but a moral compass — a symbol of how success can coexist with kindness
        and humility.
      </p>

      <p class="quote-line">
        “None can destroy iron, but its own rust can. Likewise, none can destroy a person, but their own mindset can.” —
        Ratan Tata
